# Chapter 1 Lab - Task 3: AJAX - JavaScript-initiated Asynchronous Requests

In previous task, you have learned how to send request and read response using the browser and API clients such as Postman.
In this task, you will learn how to send HTTP request directly from the code using Axios library and how to handle server responses and read their headers and body.

## Project Preparation

1. Clone or download the code from the following GitHub repo: https://github.com/houcine1amraoui/task3-axios-demo
2. Open the project folder with VS Code.
3. Open the integrated terminal, then “cd” into the “server” folder then run “npm install” command to install the dependencies used by the server (express in such a case).
4. Open the integrated terminal, then “cd” into the “client” folder then run “npm install” command to install the dependencies used by the client (axios in such a case).
5. Run the server.

## Questions

1. Call the “getAllUsers” function in the client then run its script. What has been displayed in the consoles of both the client and the server. Explain the whole process.
2. Call the “getOneUser” function in the client then run its script. What has been displayed in the console of the client. Explain the whole process.
